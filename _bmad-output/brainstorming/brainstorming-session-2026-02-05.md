# Brainstorming Session Results

**Facilitator:** Rastko
**Date:** 2026-02-05

## Session Overview

**Topic:** Bean & Brew Direct-to-Consumer Online Coffee Shop
**Goals:** Product feature ideas reflecting artisanal brand, UX concepts for coffee e-commerce, technical approach recommendations, business model considerations, and success metrics for launch

### Context Guidance

Bean & Brew is a specialty coffee roaster expanding from local farmers' markets and wholesale cafe sales into direct-to-consumer e-commerce. The founders are non-technical but have a clear vision: a simple, beautiful shop reflecting their artisanal brand. The brainstorming session focuses on balancing authentic coffee craftsmanship with accessible, frictionless e-commerce.

## Technique Selection

**Approach:** AI-Recommended Techniques
**Rationale:** For e-commerce in artisanal coffee, success requires balancing competing values (authenticity vs. convenience) while finding unexpected competitive advantages. The recommended sequence grounds ideas in stakeholder needs, discovers breakthrough innovation through cross-domain learning, and structures solutions for technical feasibility.

**Recommended Techniques:**

1. **Role Playing** (15 min) - Understand multiple stakeholder perspectives (customer, founder, technical builder, market observer)
2. **Analogical Thinking + Cross-Pollination** (20 min) - Learn from successful e-commerce and artisanal platforms, then remix for unique advantage
3. **Morphological Analysis** (15 min) - Systematically explore parameter combinations for optimal solution architecture

**Total Estimated Time:** ~50 minutes

## Brainstorming Results

### Role Playing Technique - Customer & Founder Perspectives

**Core Insights Generated:**

**[Idea #1]**: Product Story Immersion
_Concept_: Each coffee listing becomes a mini-experience—not just specs and price, but a rich narrative about origin, roasting philosophy, and tasting experience. Includes video, flavor wheel, brewing recommendations.
_Novelty_: Transforms coffee from commodity to curated experience.

**[Idea #2]**: Intelligent Taste Matching
_Concept_: Customers rate coffees and system suggests what to explore next—building personal coffee journey over time.
_Novelty_: Turns one-off purchases into curated exploration.

**[Idea #3]**: Coffee Explorer Community
_Concept_: Customers share tasting notes, rate coffees, see what others discovered. "Coffee passport" showing flavor exploration over time.
_Novelty_: Transforms transaction-based retail into community-based discovery.

**[Idea #5]**: Bean Sourcing Transparency
_Concept_: Show where each coffee comes from with maps, partner farmer stories, relationships with suppliers, seasonal availability tied to harvest cycles.
_Novelty_: Customers understand the artisanal supply chain.

**[Idea #6]**: Behind-the-Scenes Content Hub
_Concept_: Video library—roasting process timelapse, equipment setup, founders talking about decisions, seasonal rituals, failures they learned from.
_Novelty_: Builds emotional connection to the people and craft.

**[Idea #12]**: "Roaster's Reserve" Exclusive Drops
_Concept_: Limited availability experimental roasts released monthly with private community access, voting on experiments, waitlist system.
_Novelty_: Scarcity + exclusivity + community = high engagement and loyalty.

### MVP Foundation Identified

**Three Core Pillars for MVP:**

1. **Transparency (Trust)**: Bean sourcing, farmer stories, roasting visibility
2. **Community (Connection)**: Tasting notes, recommendations, shared exploration
3. **Exclusivity (Loyalty)**: Reserve drops, limited editions, member benefits

**Session Status**: Pivoting to implementation phase - building MVP with these validated concepts
